# DiskScheduler

This was a project completed in COP4600 (Operating Systems) to implement 6 different disk scheduling algorithms in Golang. The is meant to process a maximum of 20 disk requests and includes error checking for invalid cylinder positions.

**The 6 algorithms we implement are:**

    1. First come first served (fcfs)
    2. Shortest seek time first (sstf)
    3. Scan (scan)
    4. Circular scan (c-scan)
    5. Look (look)
    6. Circular look (c-look)
