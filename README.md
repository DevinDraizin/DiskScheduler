# DiskScheduler

This was a project completed in COP4600 (Operating Systems) to implement 6 different disk scheduling algorithms in Golang. The is meant to process a maximum of 20 disk requests and includes error checking for invalid cylinder positions.

The 6 algorithms we implement are:

    * First come first served (fcfs)
    * Shortest seek time first (sstf)
    * Scan (scan)
    * Circular scan (c-scan)
    * Look (look)
    * Circular look (c-look)
